Most dual and monotube shocks typically feature a two-stage valving process, the new OME NitroCharger Sport features a triple-stage valving process rivaled only by a remote canister adjustable shock. We've stacked it into the most durable shock body and adjusted it by load capacity for you. So, rather than offering a single adjustable shock, the OME engineers have done all of the testing and tuning adjustments for you. You get to choose from a selection of shock absorbers for your application based on your load-carrying configuration, guaranteeing an immediate and ideal ride without any costly fine-tuning required post-installation. The monotube style main piston valving improves transition and direction changes while the extra base valving provides more fine-tuning for comfort and control. So, the new OME NitroCharger Sport feels like a monotube without the vulnerability or the high price tag.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOLD INDIVIDUALLY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis shock is used with leaf spring SKU # 593-113.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new OME NitroCharger Sport features a triple-stage valving process rivaled only by a remote canister adjustable shock.
