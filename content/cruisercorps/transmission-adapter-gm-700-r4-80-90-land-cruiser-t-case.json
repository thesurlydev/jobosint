{"product":{"id":1462150627394,"title":"Transmission Adapter - GM 700 R4\/Land Cruiser T-case, FJ40, FJ45, FJ60, FJ62 1980-1990","body_html":"\u003cp\u003eWhen deciding to do a conversion, the first step is to select the type and size of engine you would require. You should consider things such as dependability, power, economy, speed, price range, adaptability, and availability of equipment and parts.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith reference to engine conversions, the Chevy V8 seems to be the most popular option. These adapter kits will adapt your Land Cruiser's transfer case to a GM automatic transmission that will bolt directly to a Chevy V8. Most of the time, these conversions require driveline and floor pan modification.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Adapter material is 356 T6 heat treated alloy.\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Kit includes an adapter housing, 19 spline spud shaft, new 700R4 output shaft, transfer case shifter bracket, transfer case bracket spacers, transfer case input seal, sealed bearing, gaskets, fastening hardware, and adapter instructions.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransfer Case:\u003c\/strong\u003e This adapter assembly fits 8\/1980-1\/1990 transfer cases. The transfer case design was changed to a split-case configuration with a 19 tooth internal spline on the input gear.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransmission:\u003c\/strong\u003e This kit is designed for exclusive use with the 2wd 700R-4 \/ 4L60 manufactured through 1996. The overall case length of the transmission is 23.375\u201d, has a non-removable bell housing, and a 4 bolt square rear case. Introduced in 1982, this transmission is offered in two different bellhousing \/ case designs (60 \u0026amp; 90 degree bolt patterns). All 4.3 V6 \u0026amp; GM V8 installations will require the 90 degree version. The internal components of these 700Rs can be interchanged if necessary. When this transmission was first introduced, it quickly developed a bad reputation for certain weaknesses. In 1987, GM resolved all of the problems that previously existed. In the 1990s, the name of the 700R transmission changed to 4L60. These transmissions are ideal for many conversions because of the 30% overdrive. It has a 1st gear ratio of 3.06:1; 2nd 1.62:1, and 3rd gear ratio of 1:1.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Note: It is not practical to adapt an automatic transmission to the Land Cruiser's 6 cylinder engine. The length of the engine, coupled with the length of the automatic transmission causes problems with the fuel tank, transfer case linkage location, and driveshaft angles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"product-details\" class=\"product-content-section product-content-section--active\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease allow\u00a05-7\u003cspan\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/span\u003edays before shipping.
