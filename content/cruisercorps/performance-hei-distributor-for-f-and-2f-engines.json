{"product":{"id":1462201188418,"title":"Performance HEI Distributor for F and 2F Engines FJ40, FJ45, FJ55 1958-1987","body_html":"Toyota Landcruiser F and 2F owners, get charged with a D.U.I.! NO, not that D.U.I. but the Performance Distributors DUI (Davis Unified Ignition)! Installing our DUI into the F or 2F engine means you will be \u201cDriving Under the Influence\u201d of \u201cMORE POWER!\u201d This is the original one-wire ignition system for the Toyota inline 6 cylinder. Built from high quality components, the DUI is the most powerful and reliable stand alone distributor available for the Landcruisers. Our high voltage coil, located inside the distributor cap, produces a spark strong enough to fire a massive .055\u2033 plug gap! The internal high dwell module provides longer spark duration for a crisper, smoother running engine. The mechanical advance assembly is a true Performance Distributors specialty. We use a high performance weight and spring assembly engineered for super smooth operation. The advance assembly is tuned using a Sun distributor machine to ensure a precise timing curve that will provide maximum power throughout the RPM range while eliminating engine damaging detonation. An adjustment free vacuum advance is selected to work with the centrifugal advance for better drivability and increased fuel mileage. Along with more horsepower and torque, additional benefits include quicker starting and smoother idle. The Landcruiser DUI is also designed to be virtually waterproof, making it ideal for off-road conditions. With the internal electronics protected, the DUI will continue to run when other ignition systems fail after being exposed to the off-road elements. Although the DUI is uniquely designed, replacement parts are easy to find. GM HEI replacement parts will fit right on the DUI and these parts can be found at your local auto parts store. Don\u2019t be fooled by the cheap imitation one wire distributors that are available, the DUI is unsurpassed in quality and is the original one-piece ignition system for Landcruisers! The Toyota Landcruiser DUI is covered by a one year warranty from date of purchase. Fits 58 \u2013 87 Toyota F and 2F engines.","vendor":"Cruiser Corps","product_type":"Engine","created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:56-05:00","handle":"performance-hei-distributor-for-f-and-2f-engines","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:29-05:00","published_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:55-05:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, Distributors, feed-cond-new, FJ40, FJ45, FJ55, FJ60, Ignition","variants":[{"id":12736848035906,"product_id":1462201188418,"title":"Default Title","price":"396.95","sku":"579-101","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:57-05:00","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:29-05:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"579-101","grams":2268,"image_id":null,"weight":5.0,"weight_unit":"lb","tax_code":"","requires_shipping":true,"quantity_rule":{"min":1,"max":null,"increment":1},"quantity_price_breaks":[]}],"options":[{"id":1925120524354,"product_id":1462201188418,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":3882550558786,"product_id":1462201188418,"position":1,"created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:57-05:00","updated_at":"2019-10-21T23:49:27-05:00","alt":"fj40 electronic distributor","width":1250,"height":1250,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/b5d2ba8aef537dc4b5b028a3feffddcd.jpg?v=1571719767","variant_ids":[]},{"id":3882550591554,"product_id":1462201188418,"position":2,"created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:57-05:00","updated_at":"2019-10-21T23:49:27-05:00","alt":"fj40 electronic distributor","width":2825,"height":2669,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/9cb435d6d44738ff0b9928fdaf54e226.jpg?v=1571719767","variant_ids":[]},{"id":3882550624322,"product_id":1462201188418,"position":3,"created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:57-05:00","updated_at":"2019-10-21T23:49:27-05:00","alt":"fj40 electronic distributor","width":1250,"height":1118,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/1af1f1301ede989e3a17ffbb0cd73207.jpg?v=1571719767","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":3882550558786,"product_id":1462201188418,"position":1,"created_at":"2018-07-20T10:03:57-05:00","updated_at":"2019-10-21T23:49:27-05:00","alt":"fj40 electronic distributor","width":1250,"height":1250,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/b5d2ba8aef537dc4b5b028a3feffddcd.jpg?v=1571719767","variant_ids":[]}}}
