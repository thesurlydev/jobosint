Any number of variables such as air pressure, temperature, or humidity can change the tint of paint. Even comparing one batch to another will have color variances. It is best to have a professional apply the paint to blend the color variances. While these are based off the factory colors, you should not expect a 100% color match.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Before application, aerosol paint should be shaken vigorously, for at least 1 minute after the mixing ball inside begins to rattle. If the paint has been previously used, it may be necessary to clean the nozzle by dipping it in a small amount of lacquer thinner, and swirling it around, then wiping with a clean cloth. If the ambient temperature is below 90 degrees Fahrenheit, we have found it helpful to use a hair dryer or heat gun to warm the can prior to application. Before spraying the part, we recommend testing the spray pattern on a piece of scrap material, like cardboard, just to get a feel for how the nozzle will pattern the paint.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor best results, all parts to be painted should be prepped with primer and light scuffing from a scotch brite pad or 1500 grit sandpaper. The can should be held as close to vertical as possible while spraying, and held 12-14\" from the object being painted. It is better to spray several light coats with a 40-50% overlap, to let the paint build up gradually, rather than to try to get maximum coverage with one heavy coat. Allow the paint to dry 5-10 minutes between coats. If you notice the nozzle starts to splatter, you will need to clean it with lacquer thinner as mentioned above before proceeding. Occasionally, paint will build up on the nozzle, and dry between coats, causing paint splatter.\u003c\/p\u003e","vendor":"Cruiser Corps","product_type":"Exterior","created_at":"2018-07-20T09:34:15-05:00","handle":"paint-sky-blue-854-aerosol","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:28-05:00","published_at":"2018-08-09T12:50:07-05:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, BJ, Dangerous Good, eBay, feed-cond-new, FJ40, FJ45, FJ55, FJ60, FJ62, FJ80, Memorial Day Weekend, Paint","variants":[{"id":12736727613506,"product_id":1462175465538,"title":"Default Title","price":"21.45","sku":"507-106","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2018-07-20T09:34:16-05:00","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:28-05:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"507-106","grams":454,"image_id":null,"weight":1.0009,"weight_unit":"lb","tax_code":"","requires_shipping":true,"quantity_rule":{"min":1,"max":null,"increment":1},"quantity_price_breaks":[]}],"options":[{"id":1925088706626,"product_id":1462175465538,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":32552974844090,"product_id":1462175465538,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:58:49-06:00","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:58:54-06:00","alt":null,"width":3264,"height":3264,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/IMG_0916.jpg?v=1668005934","variant_ids":[]},{"id":3882479190082,"product_id":1462175465538,"position":2,"created_at":"2018-07-20T09:34:16-05:00","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:58:54-06:00","alt":"fj40 green paint","width":566,"height":1009,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/14e6db7c275b33ddb2167abc08617b05_ff60dac7-1539-4d60-bfe7-9cf0a7c4d16c.jpg?v=1668005934","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":32552974844090,"product_id":1462175465538,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:58:49-06:00","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:58:54-06:00","alt":null,"width":3264,"height":3264,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/IMG_0916.jpg?v=1668005934","variant_ids":[]}}}
