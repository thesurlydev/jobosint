Own one and you'll never again find your lunch water- logged by shifting ice, and there'll always be a cold drink on hand during the sweltering summer months. Two separate power cords are included, one for AC operation (120 volt) at home, and one for DC operation (12\/24 volt) in your vehicle. The all-new 37 qt model is able to maintain sub-freezing temperatures in 90\u00b0 f heat, while only drawing an intermittent 1.35 amps per hour from a 12 volt power source. That's less than a single headlamp draws!\u003c\/p\u003e","vendor":"vendor-unknown","product_type":"Accessories","created_at":"2018-07-20T13:50:27-05:00","handle":"fridge-37-qt","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:08-05:00","published_at":"2018-10-19T13:01:04-05:00","template_suffix":"","published_scope":"web","tags":"100 Series, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 200 Series, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 593, 70 Series, BJ, feed-cond-new, FJ Cruiser, FJ40, FJ45, FJ55, FJ60, FJ62, FJ80, Overland Gear","variants":[{"id":12738228027458,"product_id":1462528114754,"title":"Default Title","price":"979.00","sku":"593-250","position":1,"compare_at_price":"","fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":"shopify","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2018-07-20T13:50:28-05:00","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:06:08-05:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"593-250","grams":25855,"image_id":null,"weight":57.0,"weight_unit":"lb","tax_code":"","requires_shipping":true,"quantity_rule":{"min":1,"max":null,"increment":1},"quantity_price_breaks":[]}],"options":[{"id":1925513609282,"product_id":1462528114754,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"id":3883511054402,"product_id":1462528114754,"position":1,"created_at":"2019-09-22T04:57:39-05:00","updated_at":"2019-09-22T04:57:39-05:00","alt":null,"width":600,"height":400,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/65abb1d80f5464ab8b816db9b5b4812c.jpg?v=1569146259","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":3883511054402,"product_id":1462528114754,"position":1,"created_at":"2019-09-22T04:57:39-05:00","updated_at":"2019-09-22T04:57:39-05:00","alt":null,"width":600,"height":400,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0027\/8770\/4898\/products\/65abb1d80f5464ab8b816db9b5b4812c.jpg?v=1569146259","variant_ids":[]}}}
