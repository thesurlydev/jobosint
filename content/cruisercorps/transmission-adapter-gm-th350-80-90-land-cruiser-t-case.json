You should consider things such as dependability, power, economy, speed, price range, adaptability, and availibility of equipment and parts.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith reference to engine conversions, the Chevy V8 seems to be the most popular option. These adapter kits will adapt your Land Cruiser's transfer case to a GM automatic transmission that will bolt directly to a Chevy V8. Most of the time, these conversions require driveline and floor pan modification.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Adapter material is 356 T6 heat treated aluminum alloy.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Kit includes an adapter housing, 19spline spud shaft, new TH350 output shaft, transfer case shifter bracket, transfer case input seal, sealed bearing, gaskets, fastening hardware, and adapter instructions.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransfer Case:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u00a0This adapter assembly fits 8\/1980-1\/1990 transfer cases. The transfer case design was changed to a split-case design configuration with a 19 tooth internal spline on the input gear.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransmission:\u003c\/strong\u003e This adapter kit is designed for exclusive use with the GM TH350 automatic transmission. This GM automatic was commonly found stock in vehicles from 1969-81. It was used in both pickups and car applications. The TH350 has aluminum, 1 piece case. This transmission is one of the most popular choices for engine and transmission conversions due to the overall length of 21-1\/2\u201d. The 1st gear ratio is 2.52:1; 2nd 1.52:1, and a 3rd gear ratio of 1:1.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Note: It is not practical to adapt an automatic transmission to the Land Cruiser's 6 cylinder engine. The length of the engine, coupled with the length of the automatic transmission causes problems with the fuel tank, transfer case linkage location, and driveshaft angles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease allow\u00a05-7\u003cspan\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/span\u003edays before shipping.
