You should consider things such as dependability, power, economy, speed, price range, adaptability, and availability of equipment and parts.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith reference to engine conversions, the Chevy V8 seems to be the most popular option. These adapter kits will adapt your Land Cruiser's transfer case to a GM automatic transmission that will bolt directly to a Chevy V8. Most of the time, these conversions require driveline and floor pan modification.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Adapter material is 356 T6 heat treated aluminum alloy.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Kit includes adapter housing, late 4L60E 6 to 4 bolt adapter, 19 spline spud shaft, GM VSS sensor, t-case shifter bracket, t-case bracket spacers, snap rings, retainer, sealed bearing, gasket, nylon lock nut, fastening hardware, and adapter instructions.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransfer Case:\u003c\/strong\u003e This adapter assembly fits 8\/1980-1\/1990 transfer cases.

These 4 speed overdrive transmissions are featured in late model GM trucks. The output of this transmission has a 6 bolt hex pattern. An extra adapter is included in this kit that will convert the output to a 4 bolt pattern which is compatible with the adapter housing.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Note: It is not practical to adapt an automatic transmission to the Land Cruiser's 6 cylinder engine. The length of the engine, coupled with the length of the automatic transmission causes problems with the fuel tank, transfer case linkage location, and driveshaft angles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"product-details\" class=\"product-content-section product-content-section--active\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease allow\u00a05-7\u003cspan\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/span\u003edays before shipping.
