Are you the kind of engineer who thinks, “there should really be a tool/extension/library for this, so I guess I’ll create one”? If so, we want to talk to you! We’re looking for an experienced staff engineer who understands the value that great tooling provides while keeping a sharp focus on solving for our customers’ needs. About the Team Our group is responsible for the ecosystem of tools and resources that allow external developers to be productive building extensions and integrations on top of HubSpot’s platform and providing internal teams the capabilities needed to enable these developers to use their APIs and resources effectively. Our focus is on providing value to our customers by enabling the developers supporting them to build the best solutions for their business needs. We’re ramping up to provide more flexibility and customizability in our platform and we’re looking for deeply technical and customer-focused engineers to help guide the way. Our mission, though, is not to build neat products for developers. Rather, it is to build the right set of tools that allow developers to deliver value to our customers. This focus currently includes enabling CRM UI customizations, adding support for projects which can be linked to GitHub repositories, supporting portability of objects between HubSpot portals, and other ongoing platform extensibility opportunities. As we deliver these capabilities, we believe that the route to get there is to be laser-focused on delivering a compelling, low-friction developer experience. About the Role In this role, you’ll be hands-on, writing code and contributing to the design and architecture of our systems, but will also help define and drive our teams toward the larger product vision. You’ll work across multiple teams, doing everything from delivering proof-of-concept projects to diving in when things go wrong and helping to resolve challenging production support concerns. As you get familiar with our products and vision, you’ll become a subject matter expert on our ecosystem and platform. We are looking for people who: Have experience using or even building great developer-focused tooling and services. Have years of experience consistently delivering high-value, high-impact, cross-team projects. Staff and Principal Engineers are the most senior individual contributors at HubSpot. They are leaders that continually strive to raise the bar for the engineering organization as a whole and are expected to help drive the product vision forward through contributions to our overall architecture coupled with consistent, hands-on coding. Have a thirst for technical challenges with secure, compliant, and distributed systems at scale while leveraging technologies such as Java, HBase, Vitess, Kafka, GraphQL and Dropwizard, React, JavaScript/TypeScript, etc. We’re not necessarily looking for someone who is specifically frontend or backend focused. The ideal candidates can work in either space, even though they may primarily focus on one over the other. Wish to stay hands-on in all technical aspects while leading a team of engineers and collaborating cross-functionally with internal stakeholders. Have a history of developing solutions to problems that have had an outsized impact on the organization’s business goals. Provide strategic direction for major projects. Push technologies and practices forward to improve the HubSpot ecosystem. Regularly mentor and teach engineers in their areas of expertise. Demonstrate pragmatic decision-making and problem-solving abilities. A bias for fixing problems with technology rather than process. Enthusiasm for building reliable and scalable systems. Someone who never accepts the status quo; we need engineers who can see beyond what we have, and towards what we can build, while maintaining an understanding about how to get there. Proven ability to solve complicated technical problems and analyze trade-offs with empathy for the developers.
