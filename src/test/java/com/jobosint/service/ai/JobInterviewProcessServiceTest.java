                        Since 2018, Wisetack has been building transparent and intuitive consumer lending products that help service-based businesses thrive (think HVAC companies, veterinarians, or auto repair shops).
                                                
                        Our leadership team comes from top fintech companies such as Lending Club, Affirm, and Varo Money. And we're backed by leading VCs, including Insight Partners, Greylock, and Bain Capital Ventures (investors in Airbnb, LinkedIn, Instagram, Dropbox, and more).
                                                
                        Having raised $84M, we're a well-funded startup and have invested in people and technology while growing our partnerships --- responsibly.
                                                
                        We're also proud to have received recognition from the fintech world. Awards we've won include:

                        But what you'll find us gleaming about the most is the recognition from our own customers, particularly our sky-high NPS rating of 79. (For reference, the average score is 44 for[financial services](https://customergauge.com/benchmarks/blog/financial-services-nps-benchmarks) and 36 for[SaaS companies](https://customergauge.com/benchmarks/blog/nps-saas-net-promoter-score-benchmarks).)
                                                
                        As a result of our efforts in building this healthy company culture, we've been nominated to several[Great Places to Work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/7046639) lists, such as Best Small Workplaces, Best Workplaces in the Bay Area, and Best Workplaces in Financial Services \\& Insurance.
                                                
                        Like any startup, we're in it for the long haul, and we're looking for people willing to join our journey of building something special together.
                                                
                        This process starts with our company values, which guide us in everything we do --- and have played a critical role in our success. We valiantly abide by them, and would expect you to do the same:
                                                
                        * Put customers first (they're our raison d'Ãªtre).
                        * Act fast (leverage our startup environment).
                        * Lead the way (show and tell).
                        * Take ownership (everyone is hands-on here).
                        * Be a good human (no egos, build financial products that do right by people).

                        ### Our Engineering Team Principles
                                                
                        ***Everyone is an engineer.*** No matter what their title is, everyone contributes to the code. Everyone delivers.
                                                
                        ***Initiative and ownership.*** We want every team member to lead the work they do. Design the best solutions and implement them. Ask for help from others when you need it.
                                                
                        ***One team.*** We are low ego and support each other.
                                                
                        ***Learning and growth.*** We believe growth is a huge motivator. We want everyone on the team to have an opportunity to learn and grow in their career. If you are smart and want to learn, you should be with us even if you don't have all the skills we need at the moment.
                                                
                        [Check out this post from our blog](https://www.wisetack.com/blog/wisetack-engineers) where we go into more detail about these principles.
                                                
                        ### The Role
                                                
                        Wisetack is looking for a Sr. Staff Software Engineer to be an early foundational member of our growing engineering department as a highly-impactful individual contributor (IC). You will be focused on technical concerns first and foremost; this is not a hybrid management/IC role. You will be a peer leader for your team, a force multiplier who sets examples of good code, best practices, and helps other ICs contribute to their full potential.
                                                
                        ### Responsibilities
                                                
                        * **Write good code.** You will implement new features, troubleshoot and fix bugs, and set an example for your teammates in how you do so.
                        * **Keep in mind a bigger picture than just your own work.** Maintain awareness of the work being conducted by the rest of your team, as well as other teams. Drive architectural discussions that ensure all the pieces fit together properly.
                        * **Take ownership.** You will keep an eye out for tech debt, buggy edge cases, and other pain points; bring them to the attention of your team, and help establish and prioritize a path to reducing or eliminating them.
                        * **Work efficiently and improve efficiency.** We select good tools, integrate them, and build automation to expedite our own work and get better quality at lower cost. You will need to think and work this way too.
                        * **Collaborate and communicate.** You will work closely with your hands-on Engineering Manager and your Product Manager, providing the deeply-technical perspective needed for projects to succeed.
                        * **And, most importantly, care about the business and move it forward.** We will win together. The company is very transparent, so you will be engaged and connected to our business goals.
                                                
                        ### Requirements
                                                
                        * Understanding of web applications and RESTful APIs; ideally from a full-stack perspective, but a backend-centric understanding is acceptable.
                        * Java, React, and/or AWS cloud-native services (DynamoDB, Lambda, SNS/SQS, etc) -- you don't need to be an expert in all 3 of these, but an ideal candidate will have strong experience with at least 2 (or with similar technologies)
                        * Learning and problem solving
                        * Communication, collaboration, analysis, and architecture
                        * Fintech experience is a plus
                                                
                        ### Interview Process
