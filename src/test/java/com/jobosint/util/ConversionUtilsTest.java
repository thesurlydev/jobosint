Our company is built around the idea of first understanding the person we are trying to protect using baselines of historic behaviour and ML models to determine what normal looks like for every employee of a company. Our team builds the features that take those insights and show our customers what is happening with their employees and their systems, as well as the tools and workflows for dealing with some of the most critical attacks companies can face: account takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role will involve building out features to enable customers to more quickly diagnose potentially suspicious behaviour, to make it easier to catalogue that behaviour as an attack or as benign, and more controls to optimise how the system will behave according to their needs. It will require qualities such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills and proven ability to work autonomously and asynchronously with remote collaborators and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Well rounded and can switch contexts between building frontend UI components and backend APIs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Looking to grow as an engineer as part of a strong team, learning from established engineers, product managers, and designers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Know what it takes to be successful working with remote collaborators and stakeholders, and are experienced with remote management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Detail driven and care about code quality, testing, and performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Growth-oriented, looking to increase impact, responsibility, and ownership over time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You bring up ambiguities and and clarify decisions with leadership instead of improvising solutions on the go&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you will do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on production systems to stabilise and improve existing features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with engineers, Product Managers, and Designers to define, build, test, launch, and support new product features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Responsible for both development and testing of software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Customer Support and Sales Engineering organisation on production issues and sales solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide code reviews for other engineers to catch bugs &amp;amp; problems before they make it into production&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate good judgement in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Must Haves&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3-5+ years of full stack web development experience in Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML5, React (or similar Frontend UI frameworks such as Vue, Angular), CSS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of production support experience for enterprise-class customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least 1 year of system design experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience owning testing as well as development of all software solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience working with agile development methodologies (both scrum and kanban)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience working effectively with cross-functional teams across multiple time zones with with remote stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BS degree in Computer Science or related engineering field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Nice to Have&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Airflow, Celery, AWS and/or Azure, Postgres&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with API platform development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Go&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;:2,&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;#LI-ML1&amp;quot;}&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;:12417,&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;:0},&amp;quot;10&amp;quot;:2,&amp;quot;15&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Inter&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;16&amp;quot;:10}&quot;&gt;#LI-PP1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;";
