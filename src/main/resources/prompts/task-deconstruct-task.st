Given a sentence with potentially multiple actions, break it down into sub-tasks.
Each sub-task should be a single action.
Usually a task should be broken down into subtasks if it is too complex to be accomplished in one go.
If the task does not need to be broken down into subtasks, set the sub-tasks to an empty list.

The task is:
{task}

{format}
